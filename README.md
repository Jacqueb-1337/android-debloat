# Info
A simple program written for the purpose of removing unwanted packages that have been found to be malicious or plain ad-ware. I plan on eventually making the program auto-update the package list, but that may be a while.

*Edit: Auto-update has now been added, at least for the package list file. Program auto-updates will come in the future!* 

## Installation
* Download the zip file titled 'AndroidDebloat.zip' latest release from here, unzip and simply run the .bat file. The program will hang until a device is connected and detected by adb debugging. To enable adb debugging, Google it.
